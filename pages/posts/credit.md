- **Left axis (bars)**: annual number of mortgages approved and released.
- **Right axis (line)**: average annual mortgage amount, in euros.

# Interpretation and observations

Credit correlates very well with the evolution of house prices. As an example, we will make a couple of interpretations:

- **Observation A**: We can observe how mortgage approvals were huge in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Far above the demographic upper limit, indicating the creation of a bubble.
- **Observation B**: Currently, mortgage approvals is within the demographic limit, in fact it is closer to the lower limit zone. In other words, there is no credit bubble.
- **Observation C**: The average aggregate of mortgages is constantly increasing, this is a consequence of inflation. It is the reason why within the general collective there is the thinking of _"housing always goes up"_, which has a part of truth.
- **Observation D**: Although the average aggregate of mortgages always tends upwards, there are corrections. The most important happened in the year 2007-2012.
- **Observation E**: The health crisis of the Covid-19, in the year 2020, also seems to be causing a correction, which would indicate a fall in prices.
