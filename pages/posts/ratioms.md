- **Ratio between mortgages and home sales**: if the ratio is (x), it means there a (x) mortgages per each (1) home sale.

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above shows the ratio between mortgages and home sales. It can be interpreted on the following way:

- If the ratio is equal to 1, there are as many mortgages as home sales.
- If it is greater than 1, there are more mortgages than home sales, indicating the danger of a credit bubble.
- If it is less than 1, there are more home sales than mortgages, indicating that cash purchases are gaining strength.
