# Interpretation and observations

The first chart from above shows the number of new homes built annually since 1971. The ratio of dwellings per thousand inhabitants can also be seen. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: The number of new dwellings remained almost always above 40 thousand dwellings, until the year 2009, when it dropped drastically to 10 thousand new dwellings per year.
- **Observation B**: The number of dwellings per 1000 inhabitants increased from 1971 to 2000, since then it stagnated. Currently is on decline.

The second chart shows the today existing homes by period of construction. Most of the existing houses in Catalonia today were built between the 1961 and 1980. Finally, if the pace of new construction continues at the rate shown between 2010 and 2020. Between 2021 and 2040, the number of houses to be built will be of 57200.
