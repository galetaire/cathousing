# Interpretation and observations

The graph from above shows the nominal annual appreciation of housing, i.e. whether if houses increases or decreases in value year over year (the graph does not consider return from renting, neither is inflation adjusted). We can distinguish several outstanding periods:

- 1986 - 1990: Strong revaluation of housing.
- 1991 - 1993: Stagnation, or very slight devaluation of housing.
- 1994 - 2007: Steady revaluation of housing, with 2007 being a turning point.
- 2008 - 2014: Strong devaluation of housing.
- 2015 - 2021: Slight revaluation of housing.
