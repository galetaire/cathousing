- Difference between housing growth and population growth. Green color implies housing surplus; red color implies housing deficit.

# Interpretation and observations

The graph from above shows the pace of housing construction, depending on whether it has been a year of surplus (new builds grow faster than the population), or deficit (the population is growing faster than the pace of construction). Some observations:

- **Observation A**: Between 1972 and 2000 the situation is of surplus.
- **Observation B**: Since 2001 the dominant situation is of a deficit, although there are several years of surplus (2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014).
