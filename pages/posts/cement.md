- **Left axis (bars)**: cement consumption per year, in metric tons.
- **Right axis (line)**: housing prices in euros per square meter, according to notaries.

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above shows the evolution of cement consumption, and its comparison with the evolution of housing prices, inflation adjusted. Some brief observations:

- **Observation A**: Both are historically highly correlated variables.
- **Observation B**: Real-estate cycles are readily apparent, with moments of expansion and recession, linked to debt cycles.
- **Observation C**: Cement consumption is linked to housing construction. The fact that housing construction has come to a screeching halt is an important event to consider going forward.
